# Plan Assistant (PIV Loop - Step 1)

Before implementing anything, create a detailed plan:

## Planning Steps
1. Read the relevant section of CheckList.md
2. Identify all files that will need to be created or modified
3. List dependencies and order of operations
4. Identify potential risks or blockers
5. Estimate complexity (small/medium/large)

## Output Format
- **Goal:** What we're trying to achieve
- **Files to touch:** List with brief description of changes
- **Order of operations:** Numbered steps
- **Risks:** What could go wrong
- **Ready to implement?** Yes/No

DO NOT make any changes - this is read-only planning.
