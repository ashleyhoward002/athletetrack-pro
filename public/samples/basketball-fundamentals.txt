Basketball Fundamentals Training Guide
======================================

SHOOTING MECHANICS
------------------
The BEEF Method for Perfect Shooting Form:
- Balance: Feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, weight on balls of feet
- Eyes: Focus on the back of the rim throughout the entire shot motion
- Elbow: Keep shooting elbow directly under the ball, forming an "L" shape
- Follow-through: Snap wrist down like reaching into a cookie jar, fingers pointing at rim

Arc and Release Point:
- Aim for a 45-52 degree arc on your shot
- Release the ball at the top of your jump for maximum power
- Keep your guide hand still - it should not influence the shot
- Hold your follow-through until the ball reaches the basket

Common Shooting Mistakes:
1. Thumb flicking from guide hand - causes side spin
2. Shooting on the way down - reduces power and consistency
3. Flat arc - makes the target smaller
4. Not squaring shoulders to basket - affects accuracy
5. Rushing the shot - breaks down form under pressure

BALL HANDLING
-------------
Basic Dribbling Fundamentals:
- Keep eyes up, not on the ball
- Dribble with fingertips, not palm
- Keep the ball below waist level
- Protect the ball with your body

Essential Dribble Moves:
1. Crossover: Quick, low bounce from one hand to the other
2. Between the legs: Protect the ball while changing direction
3. Behind the back: Advanced protection when defender reaches
4. Hesitation: Change of pace to freeze defender
5. In-and-out: Fake crossover to create space

DEFENSIVE STANCE
----------------
Proper Defensive Position:
- Feet wider than shoulder width
- Knees bent, butt down
- Hands active and ready
- Weight on balls of feet
- Eyes on opponent's midsection (not the ball)

Defensive Movement:
- Slide, don't cross feet
- Stay low throughout movement
- Contest every shot without fouling
- Box out on every rebound

PASSING FUNDAMENTALS
--------------------
Types of Passes:
1. Chest Pass: Two hands, direct to teammate's chest
2. Bounce Pass: One bounce, arrives at waist level
3. Overhead Pass: For longer distances or over defenders
4. One-Hand Push: Quick outlet passes

Passing Tips:
- Step into your passes for more power
- Pass away from the defender
- Make eye contact with teammates
- Fake passes to open up lanes

PRACTICE DRILLS
---------------
Form Shooting Drill:
Start 3 feet from basket using only shooting hand. Make 10 in a row before moving back one step. Focus on perfect form, not speed.

Mikan Drill:
Continuous layups alternating sides. Right hand on right side, left hand on left side. Do 50 makes total.

Ball Handling Routine (10 minutes daily):
- Stationary pound dribbles: 30 each hand
- Crossovers: 30 reps
- Between legs: 30 reps (front to back, back to front)
- Behind back: 30 reps
- Full court dribbling with all moves

Defensive Slides:
Set up cones in zigzag pattern. Slide from cone to cone maintaining defensive stance. Do 5 sets of full court.
